Supply chain management has evolved remarkably over the years. It became more digitized and automated, fundamentally changing how products are traded and managed. Efforts have been made in developing and establishing a collective of technologies and standards, to promote a leaner supply chain and create visibility for trading partners to control stock levels and predict market fluctuations.
Even so, endeavors seem to stop at the point-of-sale supply chain integration. 

This work presents a study on RFID smart shelves applied to point of sale and retail stockroom, following technologies and standards used in supply chain, to attain a top-down integration.
The dissertation starts by introducing the RFID technology and its principles,
followed by an examination of the \emph{EPCGlobal Architecture Framework} collection of technologies, currently used in supply chain, and state of the art of RFID smart shelves.

It follows by presenting an analysis of implementation options, hardware configurations and product implementation propositions.
Concludes by presenting a working crude management system implementation and tests, using off-the-shelf UHF RFID hardware components and available open-source software, integrated on typical aluminum/MDF shelves for warehouse storage.
