\chapter{System Architecture and Development} \label{sec:systemdevelopment}

In the previous chapter I presented the requirements the solution had to achieve and evaluated different development options, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.
I closed the chapter with a solution proposition, where I justified hardware and software choices.
In this chapter I will present the implementation details of such solution, going through the architecture design, development considerations and configurations. 

\section{Architecture}

The architecture used in this dissertation identically follows the EPCGlobal example, presented in figure~\ref{fig:archstructure} on chapter~\ref{sec:epcglobal}.
A detailed overview of the architecture is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:practicalarchitecture}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/platform_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the solution architecture developed in this dissertation} 
    \label{fig:practicalarchitecture}
\end{figure}

The Impinj Speedway R120 reader and Keonn Advantenna-p14 are attached behind the bottom shelf, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:shelvephoto}, radiating the entire shelve.
The reader interrogates the tags, using the \ac{epc} \ac{uhf} \ac{gen2} Air Interface Protocol, following the active \acp{rospec} configured prior to the inventory.
The inventory information is sent inside \texttt{RO\_ACCESS\_REPORT} messages to the \ac{llrp} interface of the middleware.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Photograph of the Keonn Advantenna-p14 and Impinj Speedway R120 attached behind the bottom shelf}
    \label{fig:shelvephoto}
\end{figure}

The Fosstrak \ac{fc} middlware receives the inventory information from the reader, processes it, following the configured \acp{ecspec}, and periodically generates \acp{ecreport}, which are sent to the \ac{ale} capture interface of the Capture Application.

The Fosstrak Capture Application receives the \acp{ecreport}, contextualizes them and runs additional business logic. The contextualized data is aggregated in \acs{epcis} event documents, following the \ac{cbv} vocabulary guidelines, and sent to the \ac{epcis} repository.

The \ac{epcis} repository permanently saves the \ac{epcis} data in to the \ac{epcis} database. The \ac{epcis} repository exposes the \ac{soap} query interface, which can be used to retrieve information.

The managing application to visualize the smart shelf inventory, was made using web technologies. The application is served to browsers by an NGINX static file server. The browser running the application queries the data in the \ac{epcis} repository.
Modern browsers do not support \ac{soap} natively. 
To mitigate this problem, the requests pass through a crude \ac{epcis} Web Adapter, serving as proxy between web applications and the \ac{epcis} repository. 
The proxy converts the \ac{soap} \ac{xml} requests into \ac{http} and \ac{json} endpoints, which modern browsers natively support.

All client requests hitting the platform go through an NGINX reverse proxy. This hides the topology and characteristics of the back-end servers, removing the direct internet access to them. The services on the platform are kept inside a non-public subnet and concentrate the access control on that single point. The NGINX server also allows load balancing between services instances, which is useful when there is a need to scale the platform. The proxy also deals with cross-origin resource sharing mechanism, freeing the servers from dealing with it.

All services in the platform infrastructure are containerized using Docker, and orchestrated using Docker Compose. The yaml compose file, containing the description and configuration of the platform services can be consulted in appendix~\ref{apx:composefile}.
All the code, configurations, dockerfiles and other dissertation related code and information can be consulted in the Github repository at \url{https://github.com/dvcorreia/epc-smart-shelve}~\cite{DvcorreiaEpcsmartshelve}.
Fosstrak services configurations procedures will not be described in the following sections, as they are documented in their website~\cite{FosstrakWelcome}.

\section{\acs{epc} Serialization Plan}

When companies adhere to the EPCGlobal framework, there are a few things they have to deliberate.
One of those is delineating the \acs{epc} serialization plan, where an evaluation of unique products and serial numbers is made.
The plan has to ensure that a company has enough unique product numbers to identify current and future products.

In the case of this dissertation, the serialization plan was already performed by Nespresso.
Each of their products has already an assigned \ac{gtin}, including the cardboard cases for transport.
The product cardboard cases for transport are identified by GS1-$128$ barcodes, and sleeves by \acs{ean}-$13$ barcodes.
From the \acs{ean}-$13$ barcode in sleeves, the \acs{gtin}-$13$ can be inferred and converted to \acs{gtin}-$14$ for \ac{sgtin}-$96$ encoding on \ac{gen2} \ac{epc} \acs{rfid} tags, which was covered in section~\ref{sec:sgtin}.
For the GS1-$128$ barcode in product cases for transport, an example of the barcode deconstruction is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:gs1-128barcode}.
From sleeves and boxes used for testing, only two Nespresso company prefixes were present: ``$76300544$'' and ``$76300396$'' respectively. Nestl√© Nespresso SA has many more registered. Searching in GS1 Company Database (GEPIR), it was found $18$ more, registered in Switzerland.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/gs1-128barcode.pdf}
    \caption{Deconstruction of a GS1-$128$ barcode from a Volluto coffee cardboard case for transport used in this dissertation as a test product (GS1 AI IDs on \acs{tds} Section F.1~\cite{EPCTagData})}
    \label{fig:gs1-128barcode}
\end{figure}

With the \acs{gtin}-$14$, it is possible to encode \ac{sgtin}-$96$ in \ac{gen2} tags. To write the \acp{epc} in the testing tags, it was used the Impinj Octane Java SKD \texttt{WriteEpc.java} sample code, adapted with the Fosstrak \ac{tdt} engine. Instead of generating a random \ac{epc}, the \ac{tdt} engine encodes a valid \ac{epc} with the correspondent \ac{sgtin} - company prefix, item reference and serial - in to hexadecimal, which can be passed to the \texttt{TagWriteOp} class to configure the reader and program the tag.
A tag was attached to each sleeve and transport box, with their correspondent \ac{gtin} and unique serial number as a \ac{sgtin}-$96$.

\section{Reader} \label{sec:readerconfiguration}

Throughout this dissertation, the reader was configured employing three approaches: using the Impinj Octane Java SDK~\cite{OctaneSDK}, the Impinj LTK using \ac{xml} configuration files~\cite{LTKXMLJava} and the Fosstrak \ac{llrp}Comander client software~\cite{FosstrakLLRPCommander}.
Each one has their advantages and disadvantages.

In section~\ref{sec:llrp} I specified that \ac{xml} is used to provide a human readability and abstract the \ac{llrp} standard.
In fact, it can be used to describe \ac{llrp} messages like the \textit{ADD\_ROSPEC} and \textit{SET\_READER\_CONFIG}.
This makes it easy to create and manage configuration files compared to program code, which requires knowledge of each reader manufactured SDK and referent programming language, to maintain the configurations options.

Reader configuration \ac{xml} files can be shared between the \acs{llrp}Commander and LTK-\ac{xml}. These configuration methods have a few flaws. From what I experienced, the \ac{llrp}Commander has some problems dealing with Impinj extensions and filter parameters, and requires Eclipse $3.3$ (2007 build), which is old and not maintained.
The Impinj LTK-\ac{xml} configuration method also seems to have some problems dealing with Impinj extensions~\footnote{Example: specifying \texttt{ImpinjInventorySearchMode} returns unable to convert LTK-XML to Internal Object. \texttt{C1G2InventoryCommand} has unknown element \texttt{ImpinjInventorySearchMode} which exists and is documented~\cite{ImpinjLTKProgrammers}}.
The \ac{xml} parser of the LTK-\acs{xml} requires fields, ignored Impinj reader in certain conditions, which have to be present in order to validate de \ac{xsd} schema for the configuration to be validated (e.g\ \texttt{TagInventoryStateAware}, \texttt{Tari}).

The approach suggested to configure the reader is using the Octane SKD. It forfeits the advantages of a \ac{xml} configuration file, but provides all the features expected from the reader, and is reliable and fast to configure.
Octane 6.2.0, last version at the time of this dissertation, is based on \ac{llrp} version 1.0.1 and does not support some \ac{c1g2} v1.2.0 features natively in the \ac{llrp} LTK implementation~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP}. Octane includes vendor extensions in the SDK to expose the underlying air protocol features.
The reader firmware used was version 5.12.2.240 (Build cbc9ad1d0d1).

The full code used to configure the reader can be consulted in appendix~\ref{apx:octanereaderconfig}.
The \ac{xml} configuration files used with \ac{llrp}Commander and LTK-\acs{xml} program can be consulted in appendix~\ref{apx:xmlreaderconfig}.

In section~\ref{sec:llrpspecs} I presented the \ac{rospec} wich are used to control the reader operation through the \ac{llrp} protocol. The \ac{rospec} defined for this solution will be discussed in detail in this section.
Use appendix~\ref{apx:xmlreaderconfig} \ac{xml} configuration files as reference for the following discussions.

\subsection{Antenna and \acs{c1g2} Settings}

It is good practice in \ac{uhf} \ac{rfid} systems to configure antennas aside from the \ac{rospec} definition. \ac{rf} antenna parameters are dependent on \ac{rfid} hardware and environment in which the system is deployed. \acp{rospec} allow antenna configuration, but should only specify reader control operation, namely inventory logic operations. This ensures configuration interoperability between same logic deployments in disparate \ac{rf} environments.

\subsubsection{Power parameters}

To configure the antenna and \ac{c1g2} parameters, the \ac{llrp} protocol defines the \textit{SET\_READER\_CONFIG} message. The message contains the \texttt{AntennaConfiguration} parameter with a few important fields and parameters:

\texttt{ReceiverSensitivity} specifies the effective receive sensitivity level in dBm. While testing the solution, the \ac{rf} environment conditions were optimal, as it did not existed interference from other \ac{uhf} \ac{rfid} deployments, which allowed setting the reader to the maximum sensitivity of $-80$dBm. This sensitivity is index $1$ on the \texttt{ReceiveSensitivityTableEntry}. For the R120 reader capabilities consult appendix~\ref{apx:readercapabilities}.
\texttt{TransmitPower} specifies the transmission power provided to the antennas as an offset into the \texttt{TransmitPowerLevelTableEntry}. For the Speedway R120 reader power with PoE, the maximum transmission power is $30$ dBm, which is index $81$, used in this dissertation for all test~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP, SettingReceiveSensitivity}.

\subsubsection{Class 1 \ac{gen2} Settings}

The \texttt{C1G2InventoryCommand} parameter is where the \ac{c1g2} air protocol can be tunned.
\texttt{TagInventoryStateAware} flag is used to determine how to process all the \texttt{C1G2Filter} and \texttt{C1G2Singulation} parameters in this command~\footnote{At a functional level, if the Client is managing the tag states during an inventory operation (i.e\ the Client is specifying \ac{c1g2} tag Select command Target and Action values), then it will set that flag to true and pass the appropriate fields in the \ac{c1g2} Filter and \ac{c1g2} Singulation parameters. If a reader sets \texttt{CanDoTagInventoryStateAwareSingulation} to False in \texttt{LLRPCapabilities}, then the Reader shall ignore the \texttt{TagInventoryStateAware} flag~\cite{LowLevelReader}}.

The \texttt{C1G2RFControl} parameter specifies Speedway Gen2 modes selected by Impinj system engineering to provide the best \ac{rf} performance in different environments. No Tari adjustment is necessary and any value passed by the client will be ignored in favor of Impinj mode value~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP}.
\texttt{ModeIndex} selects the operation mode~\cite{ReaderModesMade, ImpinjOctaneLLRP}. For the use case of this dissertation, it can be one of the three bellow, depending on the \ac{rf} environment in which the system is deployed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``$1002$'' (AutoSet Dense Reader Deep Scan) configures the Reader to choose the best \ac{gen2} link parameters for the environments where the tag population is relatively static and we wish to attempt to search for the weakest tag~\cite{ReaderMode1002};
    \item ``$1003$'' (Autoset Static Fast) is an adaptation of Autoset Dense Reader Deep Scan for good \ac{rf} environments;
    \item ``$1004$'' (AutoSet Static Dense Reader) is an adaptation of Autoset Dense Reader Deep Scan for difficult \ac{rf} environments.
\end{itemize}

The option used in this dissertation was \texttt{ModeIndex} ``$1002$''. The $``1004$'' is not currently available for the R120 in the ETSI european \ac{uhf} band. The ``$1003$'' does not provide assurance in warehouse malls, where other readers systems can operate and create poor \ac{rf} environment conditions.

\subsubsection{Singulation Configuration}

Impinj offers a few custom parameters supported in Octane \ac{llrp} vendor extensions, namely the \texttt{ImpinjInventorySearchMode}, a Impinj-specific inventory search mode. 
To understand search modes, we have to understand sessions. This thematic goes deep in to the \ac{c1g2} air protocol and will only briefly contextualized. \ac{gen2} defines up to four tag sessions. Sessions are states tags can transit to, in order to help the reader attempt to singulate, i.g\ read, each tag in the inventory.
When many tags are read at the same time, tag-to-tag interference can prevent certain tags to be read properly.
Sessions can be used to determine when a tag will respond to a query from the reader, and/or allow tags to maintain independent states when communicating with multiple readers at the same time.
As an example, a reader can query tags in state ``A''. If tags are properly read by the reader, they transit to state ``B''. The reader follows with another query of tags in state ``A''. Tags which were not previously read due to tag-to-tag interference, have not better \ac{rf} environment conditions to do so.

Impinj readers implement state unaware singulation, in that they provide a high-level control over the search algorithm, through \texttt{ImpinjInventorySearchMode} parameter, not interfering with any of the standard \ac{llrp}/\ac{gen2} settings~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP, UnderstandingEPCGen2}.
Impinj search modes can be consulted in appendix~\ref{apx:searchmodes}.
In this dissertation we used Tag Focus to make sure every tag was read. This was possible only because we used HID 6H2E43 tags with use Monza chips in this dissertation. For generic tags I recommend using Dual Target Inventory search mode. These algorithms will be described further in this dissertation.

Using purely \ac{llrp} settings configuration, for  interchangeability with other reader manufacturers, \ac{gen2} provides the \texttt{C1G2SingulationControl} parameter to command the singulation process in the \ac{c1g2} air protocol:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{TagTransitTime} is the measure of expected tag mobility in the field of view of the antenna where this inventory operation is getting executed.
    \item \texttt{TagPopulation} is the expected tag population in the field of view of the antenna.
    \item Session ID is the C1G2 session number that the tags use to update the inventory state upon successful singulation.
    \item \texttt{TagInventoryStateAwareSingulationAction} is used if the \texttt{TagInventoryStateAware} flag is set to true in the \texttt{InventoryParameterSpec}. It is used to query, select and deselect target tag population in a selected session.
\end{itemize}

Configurations with tunning of these setting were done for testing, but were not used in the final prototype presented in this dissertation, so no further configuration details will be done.

\subsubsection{\ac{gen2} \ac{epc} Filtering}

In the \ac{llrp} and LTK-\ac{xml} configurations I could not make it work, but with the Java Octane reader configuration, it was possible to implement \ac{epc} filtering directly through the \ac{c1g2} protocol.

The filtering works by defining filter parameters, which are sent in the air protocol, in the query process, for tags to evaluate if they correspond to the desired population to be inventoried. Only tags corresponding to such filter specifications answer back.
The \ac{c1g2} filter can be used to match any \ac{gen2} tag memory data, not \ac{epc} exclusively.
Air protocol filtering greatly reduces tag-to-tag interference, decreases \ac{rf} environment noise, lowers traffic in the network infrastructure and removes filtering work otherwise accomplished by the middleware.

The \ac{c1g2} protocol provides tree parameters which can be used to specify the filter: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{BitPointer} (integer): corresponds to the start bit position to apply the tag mask when performing tag filtering;
  \item \texttt{BitCount} (integer): defines the number of bits to compare against the mask;
  \item \texttt{mask}: is the mask to be compared. It must be of a bit length divisible by $8$, being usually represented in hexadecimal~\cite{LowLevelReader}.
\end{itemize}

In figure~\ref{fig:c1g2filter} can be observed a deduction of the parameters presented previously for an \ac{epc} example extracted from the platform.
To match both company prefixes found in the test products, the bit pointer should point to the first bit of the company prefix \ac{epc} memory, which will be the pointer to the \ac{epc} memory bank plus $14$ bits.
The bit count should be the size of the company prefix, $27$ bits. The mask has to be at least $32$ bits, which for company prefix of ``$76300544$'' the mask can be \texttt{91882001} and for ``$76300396$'' \texttt{91880D82}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/c1g2filter.eps}
  \caption{Illustration of company prefix \ac{c1g2} filtering parameter deduction}
  \label{fig:c1g2filter}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Operation Configuration}

With the antenna and \ac{gen2} protocol configured, we can focus on the operations the reader has no perform on the tag population.
In this dissertation we want to perform an inventory of the products stored in the shelve. Reader inventory operations are described in \acp{rospec}.
In section~\ref{sec:llrpspecs}, I described the parameters composing an \ac{rospec} document, particularly, the \texttt{ROBoundarySpec}, \texttt{\acs{aispec}} and \texttt{ROReportSpec} which will be discussed next.

\subsubsection{ROBoundarySpec}

The \texttt{ROBoundarySpec} parameter describes the lifetime of the reader inventory and survey operations.
The lifetime can be configured in different ways, with no clear preferable method, being to the integrator engineer to sensible evaluate an effective \ac{spec} to the project at hands.

In designing this \ac{spec}, the configurations made previously to the antenna and \ac{c1g2} protocol should be accounted, namely the search singulation algorithm mode.
For the Tag Focus search mode, the reader inventories tags in state ``A'', transitioning the tags to state ``B'' upon singulation. Tags transition back to state ``A'' in less than $5$ seconds, when de-energized~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP}.
Dual Target search mode inventories tags in state ``A'', transitioning the tags to state ``B''. Them inventories tags in state ``B'', transitioning the tags back to state ``A''.
Evaluating both search modes, the solution used consisted in periodically inventor the tags, every $5$ seconds with a $2$ seconds inventory time~\cite{ImpinjOctaneLLRP, UnderstandingEPCGen2}.
This allowed a full Tag Focus search inventory search cycle while providing enough time for the Dual Target search mode.

Translating the lifetime plan to the \ac{spec} parameters, the \texttt{ROBoundarySpec} parameter should look like code~\ref{code:boudaryspec}. The \texttt{ROSpecStartTrigger} should be periodic, with a period of $5000$ milliseconds, and no offset. The \texttt{ROSpecStopTrigger} triggers $2000$ milliseconds after receiving the trigger to start the \ac{rospec}, effectively stopping the \ac{rospec}.
These values can be changed to match the requirements of shelf clients.

\begin{listing}
    \begin{minted}[linenos]{xml}
    <ROBoundarySpec>
      <ROSpecStartTrigger>
        <ROSpecStartTriggerType>Periodic<ROSpecStartTriggerType>
        <PeriodicTriggerValue>
          <Offset>0</Offset>
          <Period>5000</Period>
        </PeriodicTriggerValue>
      </ROSpecStartTrigger>
      <ROSpecStopTrigger>
        <ROSpecStopTriggerType>Duration<ROSpecStopTriggerType>
        <DurationTriggerValue>2000</DurationTriggerValue>
      </ROSpecStopTrigger>
    </ROBoundarySpec>
    \end{minted}
    \caption{}
    \label{code:boudaryspec}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{\acl{aispec}}

For the \ac{aispec} parameters, most of the configuration were already done through the \textit{SET\_READER\_CONFIG} message, presented in the previous section.

Although, it is necessary to specify, in the \ac{xml} configuration files, the \ac{rfid} air protocol, namely \texttt{EPCGlobalClass1Gen2}, inside the \texttt{InventoryParameterSpec}.
The \texttt{AISpecStopTrigger} parameter defines the terminating boundary of an antenna inventory operation, which was set to Null to stop when \ac{rospec} is terminated~\cite{LowLevelReader}.

\subsubsection{Report Operation Report Spec (ROReportSpec)}

The \texttt{ROReportSpec} parameter describes the messages and parameters used in reports, event notifications and keepalives that are generated by the Reader and sent to the Client.

Important to consider, evaluating \ac{rfid} event based systems, is when reports are generated and sent to the Client.
In the use case of this dissertation we are not concerned with near real-time updates on the state of the inventory. We are more interested in the networking infrastructure health in which the system is deployed. In mall warehouses, this infrastructure is most likely shared with other companies. Traffic generated by readers needs to be controlled to not overburden the network infrastructure.

With this in mind, the report generation is triggered by the end of the \ac{rospec}. This will generate a report periodically every $5$ seconds.
For this behavior \texttt{ROReportTrigger} should be set to \texttt{Upon\_N\_Tags\_Or\_End\_Of\_ROSpec} with $N=0$, meaning unlimited tag in the field of view of the antenna, as it can be set to send a report upon singulation of $N$ tags~\cite{LowLevelReader}.

The \texttt{ROReportSpec} also selects which content which reports sent to the client include.
The \ac{epc} is always delivered by default.
In terms of the content useful to retrieve from the reader inventory singulation, the \texttt{ROSpecID}, \texttt{FirstSeenTimestamp} and \texttt{LastSeenTimestamp} are in the interests of the application. 
This content allows the middleware to generate accurate tag timestamp information without real-time report delivery.

\section{\acs{fc} Middleware}

To configure the Fosstrak \ac{fc} middleware we need to define \acp{lrspec} and \acp{ecspec}.
\acp{lrspec} identifies the reader, its \ac{ip} address, port number and type, which is required for abstraction layers used with proprietary communication interfaces in some readers.
The \acp{lrspec} for the Impinj Speedway R120 reader, using the \ac{llrp} interface, was already presented in the state of the art as an example, which can be seen in code~\ref{code:lrspec}.

Following the requirements of the solution, the configuration of the \ac{ecspec} has to provide two \acp{ecreport} to the capture application: one informing the tag \acp{uri} added to the shelf and another informing tag \acp{uri} removed from the shelf.
The \ac{ecspec} can also be seen in state of the art in code~\ref{code:ecspec}.
Every $5$ seconds, the middleware will report to the capture application added and removed tag \acp{uri}.
This configuration can be has complex has the integrator engineer seems fit. Since \ac{epc} filtering was achieved through the \ac{c1g2} protocol, no filtering was required in the middleware. For an example of what a more complex shelve middleware configuration for this application would look like, I defined a \ac{ecspec} which can be consulted in appendix~\ref{apx:complexecspec}.

\section{Capture application}

The Fosstrak Capture application allows the definition of business logic through the Drools engine, a Java business rules management system.
For the requirements of this solutions, it were defined two rules: one for added items and another for removed items. Each generates a single \ac{epcis} ObjectEvent document following \ac{cbv} documents and guidelines~\cite{CoreBusinessVocabulary}. The ObjectEvent contains:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\ac{epc} List}: containing a list of tag \acp{uri}.
  \item \textbf{Action type}: \texttt{OBSERVED}.
  \item \textbf{Event time}: ISO 8601 generated automatically by the capture application software.
  \item \textbf{Event Time Zone Offset}: ISO 8601 generated automatically by the capture application software.
  \item \textbf{Read Point}: ``\texttt{urn:epc:id:sgln:76300544.00000.1}'', a fictitious read point created for test purposes. It identifies the shelf within the business location.
  \item \textbf{Business Location}: ``\texttt{urn:epc:id:sgln:76300544.00000.0}'', a fictitious business location created for test purposes. Identifies the Nespresso boutique store in Aveiro. 
  \item \textbf{Business Step}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For added items ``\texttt{urn:epcglobal:cbv:bizstep:storing}'': denotes a business process where an object is moved into and out of storage within a location.
      \item For removed items ``\texttt{urn:epcglobal:cbv:bizstep:unpacking}'': denotes a business process that includes removing products (individuals, inners, cases, pallets) from a larger container (it is not the best description of the event, but the most similar provided in the \ac{cbv}).
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Disposition}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For added items ``\texttt{urn:epcglobal:cbv:disp:sellable\_not\_accessible}'': product can be sold as is, but customer cannot access product for purchase.
      \item For removed items ``\texttt{urn:epcglobal:cbv:disp:partially\_dispensed}'': a portion of a product is distributed to a customer, while additional product is retained for subsequent distribution.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The capture application, in a real world context, could implement much more complex business logic: provide information to other inventory data services, process data, and present better context regarding the \ac{cbv}. 

\section{\acs{epcis} repository and Adapter}

The \ac{epcis} repository does not require any configuration except for containerizing the service and provide a SQL database instance configured with the \ac{epcis} schema and user privileges.

To facilitate the interaction with the \ac{epcis} repository by modern web browsers, the \ac{epcis} Adapter service was developed with the Golang programming language. There is an available \ac{epcis} Webadapter by the Fosstrak team~\cite{FosstrakEPCISEPCIS}, but I could not get it to work. The service implements a crude and partial adaption of the \ac{epcis} \ac{soap} Query Interface. A functional block illustration of the service can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:epcisadapter}. It implements endpoints for the \ac{soap} \texttt{poll} \texttt{SimpleEventQuery} and \texttt{subscribe} operations through the \texttt{/query/location} and \texttt{/ws} endpoints respectively.

For the \texttt{poll} operation, the service translates \ac{http} queries in to \ac{soap} envelopes, which are sent to the \ac{epcis} repository. Response data is translated from \ac{xml} in to \ac{json}, and sent back to the web client. 
For the \texttt{subscribe} operation, the subscription endpoint converts the query into \ac{soap} and registers the subscription in the \ac{epcis} repository~\footnote{The \texttt{/subscribe} endpoint exists but it not implemented. Tests with manual set of subscriptions used to test the websockets proxy showed some bugs regarding subscription event delivery, whereby dropped and not implemented. The service proxy implementation can still receive subscription data event and deliver them using websockets, being to the client to register the subscription directly with the \ac{epcis} repository.}. The event data is sent by the \ac{epcis} repository to the root endpoint of the adapter, were is delivered in \ac{json} to the client, using websockets in the \texttt{/ws} \ac{http} upgraded endpoint connection.
The \ac{epcis} data model used to convert \ac{xml} in to \ac{json} and \ac{json} in to\ac{xml} can be seen in appendix~\ref{apx:epcisgolang}. The full service code can be consulted in the dissertation Github repository~\cite{DvcorreiaEpcsmartshelve}.

\end{figure}

\section{Management application}

The development of the management application is out of the scope of this dissertation, but will be briefly contextualized.

The application was developed for browsers as a web application. This enables most modern internet browser capable devices to use it.
It was implemented using ReactJS~\cite{ReactJavaScriptLibrary}, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with Ant Design UI components~\cite{AntDesignWorld}. The web application is compiled and minified into static web files which are served by an NGINX static file server instance.
A picture of the management application can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:webinterface}.

The application shows the date and time of the event, the \ac{epc} serial numbers, the coffee name and a count of those items. If the item is a trading box for transportation it shows a ``box'' icon next to the coffee name.
The application implements only the logic required to show in real-time the inventory information. Disable buttons are provided to show a contextualization of what the full fledge management application would look like.
