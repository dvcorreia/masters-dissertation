The load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance of the coplanar stripline, so traveling wave can transmit along the coplanar stripline. The proposed structure can make large currents along the coplanar stripline so that a strong and uniform magnetic field distribution is excited in the region around the antenna.

These spots occur in low electric field area of the electromagnetic standing wave, causing degradation of the tag's readability [3], [4]. In this paper, we present standing wave suppression technology by employing the SWC (Standing Wave Canceller). The SWC is a conductive film or dielectric with reflectance (r), installed at a specific distance (Ls) from the reflecting wall. Thus, a part of the electric field is reflected at the SWC (Efr), while another part (Etr) with phase contrast ({$\varphi$}) penetrates into the SWC and is reflected at the wall. These are synthesized into the total reflection electric field (Er = Efr + Etr) at the SWC. When Efr and Etr are anti-phase with respect to each other, e.g., the SWC is installed at the position Ls = {$\lambda$}g/4 ({$\varphi$} = {$\pi$}), Er is reduced and the standing wave is suppressed. Our SWC was able to improve tag readability, eliminating the dead-spot and saving power (4.7 dB) during tag-reading experiments in a metallic shelf.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a measurement method for tagged item classification in radio frequency identification (RFID)-based smart drawers. Specifically, the amplitude of the signal backscattered by the UHF-RFID passive tags attached to the items inside the drawer is used to identify at which of an assigned set of drawer subregions each detected tag belongs to. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) may be acquired by almost any UHF-RFID commercial reader chipset compatible with the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class1 Gen2 protocol. The RSSI model in terms of the position of the tag inside the drawer is introduced, and its selective properties are discussed through both numerical data and measurements. The cases of a single reader antenna measuring during natural opening/closing operations as well as of multiple reader antennas measuring when the drawer is static are investigated. The measurement method performance is shown through an experimental analysis in a realistic scenario, where the RSSI values are collected by using commercial UHF-RFID hardware components, and then used as the feature vector of the classification algorithm. As an example, two different classifiers are used to map each detected tag to one of the regions that the drawer is subdivided into. The classification performance of the method based on a single antenna exploiting the drawer natural sliding movements is comparable to that achievable with multiple reader antennas, while representing a cost-effective and easy-to-implement practical solution.},

The antenna layout consists of a spiral Travelling Wave Antenna (TWA) which series-feeds an array of two circularly-polarized miniaturized patches. The spiral TWA geometry allows for exciting an almost homogeneous field on the antenna surface, making the tag detection on the reader antenna (near-field reactive region) almost independent on tag location and orientation. The low-gain patch array is used to extend the read range up to the radiative near-field region. Good results in terms of read range and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) distribution have been checked experimentally, also for a stacked tag configuration.},

Nevertheless, the requirements that an RFID tag should satisfy in the different steps of the supply chain, cannot be met by general purpose commercial tags, whose adoption would lead to low-performance systems. In this paper, we are presenting the properties of an ad hoc Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tag, designed and realized in order to work properly in the entire supply chain. The proposed tag has been tested to trace some critical pharmaceutical products, containing metals and liquids, and has been compared with a pre-selected commercial tag. Both tags mount the same chip. The very impressive results, reported in this paper, clearly demonstrate that well-designed ad hoc tags effectively improve the performance of any item-level tracing system.},

The aim of this paper is to evolve from the notion of characterizing a tag to the approach of evaluating a tagged item in a system, in order to better understand the behavior of each item coming to life on the internet of things. To achieve this purpose, real store shelves are mounted and filled with 444 tagged products belonging to 24 different product families. Three automatic inventory systems are installed separately in order to perform two types of evaluation: first, the detectability of each product family and second the clustering of tagged items with similar performances in the same group regardless of their product family. Using inventory systems, this type of evaluation, eliminates the need to invest in characterization equipment and introduces a new way of reliably evaluating tagged items directly in the store. It enables the real-time detecting and targeting low-level tagging and arrangement problems without any prior knowledge of the tagged products present in the reading area and their initial quantities.},

Businesses, too, have benefited from the cloud, outsourcing much of their information technology to cloud services. Science, however, has not fully exploited the advantages of the cloud. Could scientific discovery be accelerated if mundane chores were automated and outsourced to the cloud? Leading computer scientists Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon argue that it can, and in this book offer a guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The book surveys the technology that underpins the cloud, new approaches to technical problems enabled by the cloud, and the concepts required to integrate cloud services into scientific work. It covers managing data in the cloud, and how to program these services; computing in the cloud, from deploying single virtual machines or containers to supporting basic interactive science experiments to gathering clusters of machines to do data analytics; using the cloud as a platform for automating analysis procedures, machine learning, and analyzing streaming data; building your own cloud with open source software; and cloud security.The book is accompanied by a website, Cloud4SciEng.org, that provides a variety of supplementary material, including exercises, lecture slides, and other resources helpful to readers and instructors.},

To validate the proposed design methodology, an antenna working at UHF radio- frequency identiflcation (RFID) band is benchmarked. Both simulated and measured results are shown for comparison.},

  abstract = {A new approach for RFID reader radiating structures that self-confine tag detection to a desired volume is presented. Confinement of the detection region is a critical issue for some important UHF RFID applications where object coarse location is required along with its identification. The solution avoids undesired readings outside the interrogation volume and confines the antenna radiation to reasonably sharp interrogation volumes without resorting to physical barriers. Also, the proposed solution covers simultaneously the three world assigned RFID frequency sub-bands at UHF. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated by integrating the radiating structures into bookshelves, a conveyor belt system, and a proximity point reader. These form, together with appropriate control application, the building blocks of a smart store or warehouse with automatic inventorying and billing capability.

  abstract = {Multimodal transport refers to a transport system usually operated by one carrier with more than one mode of transport under the control or ownership of one operator. Containers will ensure the transport of unitized cargo from its origin to its final destination, with efficiency and least possible risk. Container tracking can deliver several benefits for supply chain management. The main demonstrable advantages that RFID tracking can provide are cost reductions and revenue increases, smaller inventory, fast transportation and routing troubleshooting, lower insurance rates, greater efficiency and heightened security. RFID technology is used to tag, identify and track individual items, cases and pallets as they move from the manufacturing floor through the supply chain and into the hands of the buyer or consumer. As the objects move through the supply chain, wireless RFID readers can communicate with an RFID tag on the object, collect information about the object (such as a unique number) and match that number in a database to access a complete record about the object. This real-time technology provides unprecedented speed and accuracy in the supply chain. The technology can be used to identify a wide variety of objects. Radio frequency identification is used in many applications, including systematic campuses, airports by identifying objects, traffic management and vehicle access control in private areas, service management, the sorting conveyor, sorting on the conveyor belt, sorting by Lift etc. Microchip technology and invention led to the design and use of passive RFID tags (tags that can be read without the need for energy sources), thereby reducing costs. In recent years identification systems are often used in the industrial machines, the transport equipment and supplies, personnel and security administration, as well as any other field where objects need to be identified. Electronic product code (EPC) is a new standard which is well positioned to become the open standard for RFID technology and a key information tool in the retail supply chain. EPC-RFID has great potential to deliver bottom-line business benefits on a mass scale. Keywords: radio frequency identification (RFID), multimode transport using RFID, Electronic Product Code (EPC), RFID tags, wireless communication. 1. Multimodal transport -Multimodal transport operators International competition and expansion of geographical markets have forced manufacturers and traders to focus on integrated production and transport logistics strategies in order to reduce costs, and at the same time, to obtain a higher service standard. The need to control the transport costs have become as important as the need to keep down other production costs. Thus the appearance of multimodal transport services can contribute to, and foster,},

Near-field (NF) identification is preferred in inventory containing liquids and metals, as well as point-of-sale applications where the challenge is to have an antenna that can scale to large sizes and has no blind spots on its surface. This paper presents a scalable NF antenna design that utilizes non-conventional but commercially available materials that makes the antenna inexpensive. The antenna architecture comprises of a rectangular spiral microstrip line with intentional impedance mismatches and a finite ground plane made from conductive tapes and sheets sandwiched by a non-conventional substrate material. Traditional patch and loop NF antennas suffer from size limitation, surface dead spots and have far-field (FF) component that introduces stray tag reads. The proposed antenna design has no surface blind spots, easily scalable and has potential for building an inexpensive tracking shelve with confined read zones that can detect both NF and FF tags. The light weight, chemical resistant, non-toxic, and self-extinguishing properties of the antenna can significantly expand the range of applications and deployment environments of UHF RFID.},

A research started in the late 1990s at the AutoID Lab at the MIT, resulted in the creation of several enumeration schemes, which enable an individual identification of products and elements along a supply chain. These enumeration schemes follows the Global Standards proposed by GS1. The Electronic Product Code, a number coded following one of these standards, recorded on a RFID tag attached to a product, enables data information exchange among companies and their business partners. In order to foster this technology even more, a framework architecture known as the EPCglobal\textregistered{} Network was proposed. In that framework, only roles, interfaces and a common vocabulary are specified, leaving implementation details for end users. Information Systems constituted by data repositories and discovery services, fed by trace information automatically recorded during the movement of items along the supply chains may fulfill the requisites of traceability and logistic demands.},

  abstract = {Automatic goods inventory on the shelf is an important Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) application. Compared to other applications, it has some unique requirements: 1) Confined read region to avoid the cross reads to other tiers and shelves; 2) Positioning capability to know where along the shelf the tag is; 3) Low total system cost to support many shelves in the application. In this paper, an innovative UHF RFID solution is proposed for the RFID shelf. It contains two key technologies. First, the proposed near field (NF) shelf antenna in [1] is improved to provide the possibility to connect 5 cascaded antennas to one antenna port. It can save the system cost by reducing the number of needed readers. Second, a phase difference measurement based tag positioning method is proposed. To support different applications, it can provide both tier level and item level positioning for the goods on the shelf. Based on the measurement results, the proposed method can get the item level positioning accuracy with an average error of 4.16cm. It can also get 100\% tier level positioning accuracy.},

It was developed to demonstrate the improvement possibility of current blood stock management systems and as the submission to the 2014 IEEE AP-S Student Design Contest: Antennas for RFID Application. The system is composed of a cabinet model, a transceiver unit, and a PC with the controlling software. A new implementation of pseudolocalization principle is used to localize the blood bags that are equipped with dedicated passive tags designed to be resilient to blood proximity and small size. The detector antennas are placed at the drawers bottoms and additional passive tags are utilized to identify individual locations in each drawer. The transceiver unit is made from off-the-shelf commercial electronic boards and wirelessly controlled by software run on the PC. The entire system is small, transportable, battery powered, and low cost.},

  abstract = {We present Bayesian filter of variable RF transmission power (BFVP), a Bayesian filter-based algorithm and a variable power radio-frequency identification (RFID) model for localizing passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID tags in complex environments, such as distribution centers/warehouses and retail sales floors. It enables a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID-equipped robot to provide the precise locations of passive UHF RFID tagged items. First, the robot navigates and fully covers a target space to collect observation of RFID tags using a COTS reader at variable RF transmission power. Every observation is associated with a pose, where the robot receives the response, and the RF transmission power. When the robot collects all responses from an RFID tag, BFVP can estimate the location of the tag, hence, localizing the tagged item. We tested the performance of BFVP in a mock apparel store; it exhibits less than 0.5-m localization error in the practical retail environment with significant multipath fading. Our proposed BFVP could enable promising applications that could greatly improve the efficiency of supply chain management by providing the precise locations of RFID tagged items.},
