The proposed structure can make large currents along the coplanar stripline so that a strong and uniform magnetic field distribution is excited in the region around the antenna.

These spots occur in low electric field area of the electromagnetic standing wave, causing degradation of the tag's readability [3], [4]. In this paper, we present standing wave suppression technology by employing the SWC (Standing Wave Canceller). The SWC is a conductive film or dielectric with reflectance (r), installed at a specific distance (Ls) from the reflecting wall. Thus, a part of the electric field is reflected at the SWC (Efr), while another part (Etr) with phase contrast ({$\varphi$}) penetrates into the SWC and is reflected at the wall. These are synthesized into the total reflection electric field (Er = Efr + Etr) at the SWC. When Efr and Etr are anti-phase with respect to each other, e.g., the SWC is installed at the position Ls = {$\lambda$}g/4 ({$\varphi$} = {$\pi$}), Er is reduced and the standing wave is suppressed. Our SWC was able to improve tag readability, eliminating the dead-spot and saving power (4.7 dB) during tag-reading experiments in a metallic shelf.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a measurement method for tagged item classification in radio frequency identification (RFID)-based smart drawers. Specifically, the amplitude of the signal backscattered by the UHF-RFID passive tags attached to the items inside the drawer is used to identify at which of an assigned set of drawer subregions each detected tag belongs to. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) may be acquired by almost any UHF-RFID commercial reader chipset compatible with the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class1 Gen2 protocol. The RSSI model in terms of the position of the tag inside the drawer is introduced, and its selective properties are discussed through both numerical data and measurements. The cases of a single reader antenna measuring during natural opening/closing operations as well as of multiple reader antennas measuring when the drawer is static are investigated. The measurement method performance is shown through an experimental analysis in a realistic scenario, where the RSSI values are collected by using commercial UHF-RFID hardware components, and then used as the feature vector of the classification algorithm. As an example, two different classifiers are used to map each detected tag to one of the regions that the drawer is subdivided into. The classification performance of the method based on a single antenna exploiting the drawer natural sliding movements is comparable to that achievable with multiple reader antennas, while representing a cost-effective and easy-to-implement practical solution.},

The antenna layout consists of a spiral Travelling Wave Antenna (TWA) which series-feeds an array of two circularly-polarized miniaturized patches. The spiral TWA geometry allows for exciting an almost homogeneous field on the antenna surface, making the tag detection on the reader antenna (near-field reactive region) almost independent on tag location and orientation. The low-gain patch array is used to extend the read range up to the radiative near-field region. Good results in terms of read range and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) distribution have been checked experimentally, also for a stacked tag configuration.},

In this paper, we are presenting the properties of an ad hoc Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tag, designed and realized in order to work properly in the entire supply chain. The proposed tag has been tested to trace some critical pharmaceutical products, containing metals and liquids, and has been compared with a pre-selected commercial tag.

In order to achieve accurate location sensing of objects sitting on the shelf, we utilize a novel localization algorithm that utilizes detected changes in a tag's readability to infer the presence of neighboring tags. According to our experimentation results, with a single RFID reader antenna for two wooden shelves of size 91 cm \texttimes{} 152 cm, our smart-shelf system estimates nine box-level object locations with an average error of just 18.48 cm, which is a 71\% improvement in accuracy compared with the previously published k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm.},

The proposed antenna was designed to have a strong and uniform Hz-field over a broad antenna aperture to identify the various items with stable reading performance. To obtain a strong near Hz-field, two coupled patches are employed along with a microstrip-line feed, resulting in average Hz of -15 dBA/m on antenna aperture (30 \texttimes{} 30 \texttimes{} 10 cm3). We also measured the reading range, and it confirmed that the proposed antenna is suitable for a commercial RFID smart-shelf application.},

The aim of this paper is to evolve from the notion of characterizing a tag to the approach of evaluating a tagged item in a system, in order to better understand the behavior of each item coming to life on the internet of things. To achieve this purpose, real store shelves are mounted and filled with 444 tagged products belonging to 24 different product families. Three automatic inventory systems are installed separately in order to perform two types of evaluation: first, the detectability of each product family and second the clustering of tagged items with similar performances in the same group regardless of their product family. Using inventory systems, this type of evaluation, eliminates the need to invest in characterization equipment and introduces a new way of reliably evaluating tagged items directly in the store. It enables the real-time detecting and targeting low-level tagging and arrangement problems without any prior knowledge of the tagged products present in the reading area and their initial quantities.},

  abstract = {A guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples.The emergence of powerful, always-on cloud utilities has transformed how consumers interact with information technology, enabling video streaming, intelligent personal assistants, and the sharing of content. Businesses, too, have benefited from the cloud, outsourcing much of their information technology to cloud services. Science, however, has not fully exploited the advantages of the cloud. Could scientific discovery be accelerated if mundane chores were automated and outsourced to the cloud? Leading computer scientists Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon argue that it can, and in this book offer a guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The book surveys the technology that underpins the cloud, new approaches to technical problems enabled by the cloud, and the concepts required to integrate cloud services into scientific work. It covers managing data in the cloud, and how to program these services; computing in the cloud, from deploying single virtual machines or containers to supporting basic interactive science experiments to gathering clusters of machines to do data analytics; using the cloud as a platform for automating analysis procedures, machine learning, and analyzing streaming data; building your own cloud with open source software; and cloud security.The book is accompanied by a website, Cloud4SciEng.org, that provides a variety of supplementary material, including exercises, lecture slides, and other resources helpful to readers and instructors.},

  abstract = {Recent news have reported an increasing number of people victims of drug-induced deaths. The reason is the fact that many patients do not have medical background or they might simply neglect certain information about the medicine they take. With a careful analysis of the requirements involved in taking medicines and by consulting physicians, it was possible to propose an intelligent medicine cabinet concept; designed to be as simple as using a conventional medicine cabinet, increasing its usability and acceptance by the construction of an electronic solution. Radio Frequency Identification was used in this work to get information from the user, medicines and prescriptions automatically, allowing a guided medication process. The proposed concept described in this paper is an attempt to facilitate people's lives to take medicines, improving medication adherence and managing related information.},

In order to determine the distribution of excitations that generate the desired uniform near-field distribution, the method of maximum power transmission efficiency has been used. By introducing more than one test receiving antennas in the interrogation zone and maximizing the power transmission efficiency between the array to be designed and the test receiving antennas, an optimized distribution of excitations can be obtained and then realized by a feeding network. The designed reader antenna is demonstrated to be able to track all the tags inside the metal cabinet and can be easily adjusted to various cabinet configurations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology has re- ceived special attention, especially for identifying and tracking objects, ani- mals and people through a wireless communication connection. Radio waves transmitted from a reader, through an antenna to an identifier, called tag, which attributes an Unique Identification Number (UID) to a object, ani- mal or person are used for this communication. This technology not only helps to identify, but also to collect data attributes about a certain person or object. However, RFID still has important limitations, which slows down its growth considerably. The two main reasons for that are related not only with the excessive cost of this system due to the readers and antennas, but also because it uses non-reconfigurable readers to new communication protocols, tags or even changes in frequencies. Therefore, the first purpose of this project was to develop a front-end to be included into a low-cost reconfigurable RFID UHF reader, based on FPGA or DSP, with an embed- ded processor and a software-defined radio. In a long-term, it is intended to have readers that does not require commercial RFID transceivers. The second purpose of this study was to develop a simple and low-cost ma- nufacturing process of antennas and tags in flexible and organic material. Firstly, a front end for RFID UHF bandwidth across the European Union and in the North America was proposed to be implemented in the future. This front end was designed to be low-cost, robust, in order to emit and receive radio signals. Secondly, two antennas, respectively, for an American and European UHF bandwidth RFID reader were developed in this project. Ultimately, an ordinary home inkjet-printer was modified to jet conductive ink, created as a part of this study, to print tag antennas in paper based substrate. All of the fundamental parameters that needed to be evaluated for antennas were experimentally simulated and tested for the two antennas. Both showed high performances, particularly, the antenna for a European UHF bandwidth RFID reader. This antenna obtained results more simi- lar to the numerical model, and experimental findings were even better for some parameters. Its performance was found to be high even for an Ame- rican UHF bandwidth RFID reader. Furthermore, seven RFID tags were developed, meaning they were designed and printed on the modified home inkjet-printer, and then its performance was tested. Although one of these tags showed not to be highly efficient, all tags worked adequately for the purpose. Therefore, we can conclude that our technology allowed to print RFID tags using a modified home inkjet-printer, indicating that this method can offer more independency to RFID tag manufacturers and, also allow an extensive use of this system in I\&D environment, University or Schools, since it is simple and cheap.},

Objects without RFID tags or objects with tags that for some reason are unreadable will not be noted at all when positioned within an RFID reader antenna's interrogation zone. In this paper, we investigate how UHF RFID reader systems for smart shelf applications could also be used for classification and distance estimation of non RFID tagged objects, if the reader modules provide access to antenna S-parameters. The investigation is performed with an inset fed microstrip antenna where objects of different materials are positioned at different heights above the antenna. It is shown how objects are detected and classified in terms of their materialistic properties through S-parameter analysis and how the distance from the antenna to the object could be estimated.},

Several solutions have been proposed during past years but most of them are complicate and expensive in the final implementation. In this paper a very simple solution based on a transmission line concept will show that is possible to achieve a limitation of the reading zone in a simple and effective way by using very simple ``antenna'' or better to say: ``coupling mechanism system between RF signal generated by RFID reader and UHF RFID Tag''.},

Confinement of the detection region is a critical issue for some important UHF RFID applications where object coarse location is required along with its identification. The solution avoids undesired readings outside the interrogation volume and confines the antenna radiation to reasonably sharp interrogation volumes without resorting to physical barriers. Also, the proposed solution covers simultaneously the three world assigned RFID frequency sub-bands at UHF. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated by integrating the radiating structures into bookshelves, a conveyor belt system, and a proximity point reader. These form, together with appropriate control application, the building blocks of a smart store or warehouse with automatic inventorying and billing capability. The radiating structure concept is explored by full-wave simulations and it is validated both with near-field measurements and with tag reading scores. Pilot commercial kits are being tested in real stores in collaboration with two industrial partners.},

  abstract = {O interesse por sistemas de identifica\c{c}\~ao por radiofrequ\^encia (RFID) tem
 aumentado de forma significativa nos \'ultimos anos, principalmente na identifica\c{c}\~ao e tracking de objectos, animais e pessoas atrav\'es de um modo de
 comunica\c{c}\~ao sem fios. Esta comunica\c{c}\~ao \'e feita por ondas de r\'adio que s\~ao
 transmitidas por um leitor, atrav\'es de uma antena a um identificador (etiqueta)
 que atribui a um objeto uma identidade \'unica, o chamado c\'odigo de
 identifica\c{c}\~ao \'unico. Esta tecnologia n\~ao s\'o identifica, mas tamb\'em armazena
 dados atribu\'idos a determinado objeto, animal ou pessoa. No entanto,
 o RFID apresenta ainda consider\'aveis limita\c{c}\~oes, que inviabilizam o seu uso.
 Duas importantes raz\~oes que tornam esta tecnologia menos interessante \_e
 o seu excessivo custo, causado n\~ao s\'o pelos pre\c{c}os dos leitores e das antenas,
 mas tamb\'em pelo pre\c{c}o do processo de fabrico das etiquetas; e devido
 ao facto de serem usados leitores n\~ao-reconfigur\'aveis a novos protocolos
 de comunica\c{c}\~ao, novas etiquetas ou at\'e mesmo altera\c{c}\~oes de frequ\^encias.
 O primeiro objetivo deste projeto foi ent\~ao desenvolver um front end de
 radiofrequ\^encia para a constru\c{c}\~ao de um leitor RFID UHF reconfigur\'avel
 de baixo custo, baseado em circuitos program\'aveis DSP ou FPGA, com
 um processador embutido e software-defined radio. Com isto pretende-se
 que os leitores RFID n\~ao dependam de transceivers RFID comerciais. Al\'em
 disso, com este estudo pretendeu-se tamb\'em a desenvolver antenas e etiquetas
 RFID, em material org\^anico flex\'ivel, com um processo de produ\c{c}\~ao
 de etiquetas simples e de baixo custo. Na primeira parte deste projeto, foi
 proposto um front end para a banda RFID UHF Europeia e para a banda
 Americana, que poder\'a ser usado, no futuro, no desenvolvimento de um
 leitor RFID. Este front end foi desenhado para ser robusto, de baixo custo,
 e com o objetivo de emitir e receber sinais de r\'adio. Na segunda parte,
 foram desenvolvidas duas antenas para leitores, uma para a banda RFID
 UHF Americana e outra para a banda RFID UHF Europeia. Por \_ultimo, foi
 alterada uma impressora convencional, comercialmente dispon\'ivel, e foram
 feitas tamb\'em altera\c{c}\~oes na tinta de impress\~ao, tornando-a condutora, para
 impress\~ao de antenas para etiquetas RFID em substratos \_a base de papel.
 Todos os par\^ametros fundamentais das antenas foram simulados numericamente
 e testados experimentalmente. As duas antenas testadas mostraram
 boas performances, em particular, a antena para a banda RFID UHF Europeia,
 cujos valores resultantes dos testes experimentais foram muitos similares
 aos encontrados computacionalmente, sendo mesmo melhores para
 alguns par\^ametros. Esta antena, n\~ao s\'o apresentou uma boa performance
 na banda mencionada, mas tamb\'em na banda RFID UHF Americana. Foram
 desenvolvidas sete etiquetas RFID, ou seja, desenhadas e impressas
 usando a impressora jato de tinta modificada, e testadas posteriormente.
 Todas as etiquetas funcionaram, embora uma delas n\~ao tenha apresentado
 resultados t\~ao satisfat\'orios. Podemos ent\~ao concluir que a nossa tecnologia
 permitiu ter etiquetas impressas por uma impressora convencional e, desta
 forma, poder\'a oferecer uma maior independ\^encia \'as empresas que as produzem,
 podendo mesmo ser utilizada em ambientes de I\&D, em Universidades
 ou Escolas, de modo simples e barato.},

The emulator features (1) the generation of multiple standards codes (ISO, GS 1 and even proprietary) RFID tag events, (2) the dynamic tag population control emulating moving tags (3) the implementation in Raspberry Pi 3 which allows on-site uses (4) compatiblility to Low Level Reader Protocol (LLRP). The emulator significantly mitigates the RFID information system testing and evaluation by completely eliminating the physical tags placement and reading with physical interrogator. The emulator implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 inter-working with our multicode filtering and collection middleware will be brought to IoT2016 venue to show how we generate virtual RFID reading events and sort and deliver to designated information system.},

  abstract = {Multimodal transport refers to a transport system usually operated by one carrier with more than one mode of transport under the control or ownership of one operator. Containers will ensure the transport of unitized cargo from its origin to its final destination, with efficiency and least possible risk. Container tracking can deliver several benefits for supply chain management. The main demonstrable advantages that RFID tracking can provide are cost reductions and revenue increases, smaller inventory, fast transportation and routing troubleshooting, lower insurance rates, greater efficiency and heightened security. RFID technology is used to tag, identify and track individual items, cases and pallets as they move from the manufacturing floor through the supply chain and into the hands of the buyer or consumer. As the objects move through the supply chain, wireless RFID readers can communicate with an RFID tag on the object, collect information about the object (such as a unique number) and match that number in a database to access a complete record about the object. This real-time technology provides unprecedented speed and accuracy in the supply chain. The technology can be used to identify a wide variety of objects. Radio frequency identification is used in many applications, including systematic campuses, airports by identifying objects, traffic management and vehicle access control in private areas, service management, the sorting conveyor, sorting on the conveyor belt, sorting by Lift etc. Microchip technology and invention led to the design and use of passive RFID tags (tags that can be read without the need for energy sources), thereby reducing costs. In recent years identification systems are often used in the industrial machines, the transport equipment and supplies, personnel and security administration, as well as any other field where objects need to be identified. Electronic product code (EPC) is a new standard which is well positioned to become the open standard for RFID technology and a key information tool in the retail supply chain. EPC-RFID has great potential to deliver bottom-line business benefits on a mass scale. Keywords: radio frequency identification (RFID), multimode transport using RFID, Electronic Product Code (EPC), RFID tags, wireless communication. 1. Multimodal transport -Multimodal transport operators International competition and expansion of geographical markets have forced manufacturers and traders to focus on integrated production and transport logistics strategies in order to reduce costs, and at the same time, to obtain a higher service standard. The need to control the transport costs have become as important as the need to keep down other production costs. Thus the appearance of multimodal transport services can contribute to, and foster,},

Near-field (NF) identification is preferred in inventory containing liquids and metals, as well as point-of-sale applications where the challenge is to have an antenna that can scale to large sizes and has no blind spots on its surface. This paper presents a scalable NF antenna design that utilizes non-conventional but commercially available materials that makes the antenna inexpensive. The antenna architecture comprises of a rectangular spiral microstrip line with intentional impedance mismatches and a finite ground plane made from conductive tapes and sheets sandwiched by a non-conventional substrate material. Traditional patch and loop NF antennas suffer from size limitation, surface dead spots and have far-field (FF) component that introduces stray tag reads. The proposed antenna design has no surface blind spots, easily scalable and has potential for building an inexpensive tracking shelve with confined read zones that can detect both NF and FF tags. The light weight, chemical resistant, non-toxic, and self-extinguishing properties of the antenna can significantly expand the range of applications and deployment environments of UHF RFID.},

Two meandered microstrip lines that are 90\textdegree -of-phase form the near-field antenna rim around a far-field patch antenna. The patch antenna is fed by those meandered lines along the vertices on its orthogonal points, resulting in circular polarization. The near-field radiation is evenly distributed with no surface dead zones, and the far-field radiation pattern is symmetrical with a 90\textdegree{} half-power beam-width in both azimuth and elevation planes. The antenna operates in the North American UHF RFID band (902-928 MHz) with a 50 MHz impedance bandwidth. The antenna's gain and axial ratio at the band's center frequency of 915 MHz is 3.3 dBi, and 1.4 dB, respectively. This antenna is low-profile, low-cost and recyclable as it is constructed from polyolefin substrate and copper foils.},

This research emphasizes on how to improve Taiwan's present clinic pharmacy dispensing system by introducing RFID technique to assist small clinic which hires single pharmacist that can't perform repetitive inspections. Human factor and new processes are took into consideration to enhance the dispensing accuracy. By installing real system and reestablishing the dispensing process, our primary goal is to ensure the medication safety and to reduce the medicine risk. Our efforts include prescription electrolyzed at the front end, light-indicator-aided picking system to help the pharmacist taking the exact medicine during dispensing, RFID embedded cabinet to perform the double check procedure, electrical weighting scale to make sure the right amount and CCD camera to reconstruct the scene when errors do happen.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a general overview on the EPCglobal\textregistered{} Network proposed by GS1, a global and non-profit organization. Recent advances in RFID technology allowed its crescent use, as well as its close relation with a novel paradigm, the Internet of Things, which proposes the integration of objects of the quotidian use to the Internet. A research started in the late 1990s at the AutoID Lab at the MIT, resulted in the creation of several enumeration schemes, which enable an individual identification of products and elements along a supply chain. These enumeration schemes follows the Global Standards proposed by GS1. The Electronic Product Code, a number coded following one of these standards, recorded on a RFID tag attached to a product, enables data information exchange among companies and their business partners. In order to foster this technology even more, a framework architecture known as the EPCglobal\textregistered{} Network was proposed. In that framework, only roles, interfaces and a common vocabulary are specified, leaving implementation details for end users. Information Systems constituted by data repositories and discovery services, fed by trace information automatically recorded during the movement of items along the supply chains may fulfill the requisites of traceability and logistic demands.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of radiofrequency identification, RFID, applied to logistics of distribution of an specific product in its points of sale, focusing on the retailer stock, searching for the best efficiency in the replenishment of products. One of the key elements of a Lean Supply system is to achieve a minimum, but satisfactory stock level at each sector of the whole supply chain, from the factory to the end retailer. By controlling the retailer stock level careful and precisely, a very efficient supply chain can be achieved. This paper intends to enable a lean supply system through the application of a smart shelf with RFID technology, preventing out-of-stock situations. As a proof of concept, a smart shelf prototype was developed to investigate the performance of RFID in its state-of-the-art. Some technology fundamentals are explained to ease the understanding of the case study. The challenges involved in a retailer-oriented application are discussed, as well as the architecture proposed as a solution. The equipments acquired for the tests and the experimental procedures applied to choose the best arrangement are described concisely. The final results are presented as tables and comparative graphics comprising performance and the conditions in which those equipments performed well. The conclusion of this paper shows the achieved performance ratings, presenting the feasibility of RFID as an enabling technology in smart shelves to compose a lean supply system.

INTRODUCTION Nowadays, the out-of-stock situation is a major issue in logistics of manufacturers and retailers, leading to enormous losses possibilities [1]. This knowledge area has some specific terms that are widely used, demanding a brief description of them. Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) term refers to the storage logistics and designates each and every unique stock item. They are usually associated with an identification code [2]. Out-of-Stock term is used under two basic situations: as a performance index in supply chain management [3] and to describe the situation of the literal meaning. The search for solutions to mitigate the occurrence of out-of-stock situation in the points of sale and retailers is being pursued for a long time, as this problem causes lots of financial losses for everybody involved in the whole supply chain of products.},

Moreover, the designed patch antenna and ground planes have reduced size, for best integration of the reader in the required application. The combination of antenna and reconfigurable feeding network has been tested through simulations, showing good performance over the EU RFID frequency band (865-868 MHz). Due to its flexible and inexpensive structure, the proposed reconfigurable feeding system is a promising alternative to standard circular polarized reader antenna approaches.},

We focus on autonomous robots, capable of entering a previously unknown environment, creating a 3D map of it, navigating safely in it, localizing themselves while moving, then localizing all RFID tagged objects and pinpointing their locations in the 3D map with cm accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents the complex joint problem, including challenges from the field of robotics - i) sensors utilization, ii) local and global path planners, iii) navigation, iv) simultaneous localization of the robot and mapping - and from the field of RFIDs - vi) localization of the tags. We restrict our analysis to solutions, involving commercial UHF EPC Gen2 RFID tags, commercial off-the-self RFID readers and 3D real-time-only methods for tag-localization. We briefly present a new method, suitable for real-time 3D inventorying, and compare it with our two recent methods. Comparison is carried out on a new set of experiments, conducted in a multipath-rich indoor environment, where the actual problem is treated; i.e. our prototype robot constructs a 3D map, navigates in the environment, continuously estimates its poses as well as the locations of the surrounding tags. Localization results are given in a few seconds for 100 tags, parsing approximately 100000 measured samples from 4 antennas, collected within 4 minutes and achieving a mean 3D error of 25cm, which includes the error propagating from robotics and the uncertainty related to the "ground truth" of the tags' placement.},

  abstract = {A complete UHF radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based system capable of localizing individual blood bags inside storage cabinet drawers is presented. It was developed to demonstrate the improvement possibility of current blood stock management systems and as the submission to the 2014 IEEE AP-S Student Design Contest: Antennas for RFID Application. The system is composed of a cabinet model, a transceiver unit, and a PC with the controlling software. A new implementation of pseudolocalization principle is used to localize the blood bags that are equipped with dedicated passive tags designed to be resilient to blood proximity and small size. The detector antennas are placed at the drawers bottoms and additional passive tags are utilized to identify individual locations in each drawer. The transceiver unit is made from off-the-shelf commercial electronic boards and wirelessly controlled by software run on the PC. The entire system is small, transportable, battery powered, and low cost.},

  abstract = {We present Bayesian filter of variable RF transmission power (BFVP), a Bayesian filter-based algorithm and a variable power radio-frequency identification (RFID) model for localizing passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID tags in complex environments, such as distribution centers/warehouses and retail sales floors. It enables a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID-equipped robot to provide the precise locations of passive UHF RFID tagged items. First, the robot navigates and fully covers a target space to collect observation of RFID tags using a COTS reader at variable RF transmission power. Every observation is associated with a pose, where the robot receives the response, and the RF transmission power. When the robot collects all responses from an RFID tag, BFVP can estimate the location of the tag, hence, localizing the tagged item. We tested the performance of BFVP in a mock apparel store; it exhibits less than 0.5-m localization error in the practical retail environment with significant multipath fading. Our proposed BFVP could enable promising applications that could greatly improve the efficiency of supply chain management by providing the precise locations of RFID tagged items.},
